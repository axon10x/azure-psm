The SQL files in this folder are to create the Azure SQL databases.

For fully programmatic deployment in ../azure/deploy.sh, these were used to create the .bacpac files imported to the Azure SQL databases after those were created.

Alternately, depending on your environment you may choose to use sqlcmd or another available utility to connect to the Azure SQL databases and deploy schemas, objects, and data.
