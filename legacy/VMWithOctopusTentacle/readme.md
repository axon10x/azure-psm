This folder contains an ARM template to deploy a Windows VM to Azure. The VM will have anti-malware. It will also have the Octopus Tentacle extension installed and configured for an Octopus server per values in the parameters file.

The VM will have a public IP address and at least one data disk. If either of those conditions are inappropriate for your context, please edit the template and parameters file accordingly.

__Pre-requisites:__
- Azure subscription (duh)
- Existing resource groups (RGs). The template contains parameters for separate resource groups for the VM itself, for networking resources, and for diagnostics logging. You can use the same RG for all of these (good for "try it out" where you'll delete the whole RG), or use a different RG for each purpose (good when there are durable networking and diagnostics resources already in place).
- Existing VNet, subnet, and NSG in the RG you'll specify that contains network resources ("resourceGroupNameNetwork" parameter).
- Existing standard storage account for diagnostics.

__ARM template preparation:__
- Edit the azuredeploy.parameters.json file and provide appropriate values.
- Consult azuredeploy.json for parameter descriptions if uncertain what to provide for any parameter value.

__Notes:__
- An availability set name is required (whether it exists or not). This parameter value cannot be blank.
- An NSG is optional. If left blank, the VM NIC will not be associated with an NSG. In this case, I suggest that the subnet where the VM will be deployed has an NSG so that the VM inherits its subnet's NSG protection.
- The number of data disks must be between 1 and 800. Negative numbers are not allowed. Zero is also not allowed due to a current limitation in the ARM template language: see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-multiple#resource-iteration

__Deployment modalities:__
1. Powershell: use the deploy.ps1 in this folder, which deploys from both azuredeploy.json and azuredeploy.parameters.json. Provide values for the parameters in azuredeploy.parameters.json and run it from a Powershell prompt. For more info, see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy
2. From Azure portal: use the "Deploy to Azure" button below. Note that this does not use the azuredeploy.parameters.json file; you will need to enter all parameter values in the Azure portal.
